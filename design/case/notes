Thoughts about the case:

1.  Preferently extruded (cost effective).
2. Aluminum is a good option, although if it has some ferrum the penetration depth would be better, improving EMI shielding.
3. The case must allow to change between different connectors. The less expensive part is the one that should change in case of a connector redesign. Beware, there are really big connectors out there.
4. Rail mounting I guess. Have to check about vibration performance
5. It must provide good heatsinking for SMD stuff.
6. Splash-proof? What about the USB connector?
7. A 3-board stack should be fine. Check rigidity of a 4 board stack.

So far, I've this in my mind:
--- <-case
Super fancy board

Puma

Connector Board
--- <-case

8. Needs holes somewhere to screw to the car.

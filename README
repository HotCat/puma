This is the hardware design of FreeEMS, a free engine management system.

Originally developed by jharvey, this branch uses his schematics, but adds a few extra circuits and redesigns the pcb, in order to fit the argentinian market better.

This design is NOT INTENDED to be as configurable as the official hardware, but to be suitable for production.

Main goals are:
* SMD
* 2 layers
* 6 hi/low Z injector outputs
* 6 ignition outputs
* Fuel pump output
* 2 aux power outputs
* 4 temperature inputs
* MAP, baro, battery voltage
* 3 aux analog inputs
* knock sensor
* WB lambda
* USB for tuning and datalogging

Planned release: 20/6/2011 (or never)

This is the hardware design of FreeEMS, a free engine management system.

Originally developed by jharvey, this branch uses his schematics, but adds a few extra circuits and redesigns the pcb, in order to fit the argentinian market better.

This design is NOT INTENDED to be as configurable as the official hardware, but to be suitable for production.

Main goals are:
* SMD
* 2 layers, 10x13cm board
* connector board for engine interface
* industrial grade specs
* 8 hi/low Z injector outputs
* 4 ignition outputs
* fuel pump control
* stepper motor control
* 2 aux power outputs
* MAP, AAP, MAF, TPS, lambda, battery voltage, EGT, MAT, IAT, CLT, aux temperature input, aux GP input
* 6 protected GPIO
* USB for tuning and datalogging

Planned release: 20/6/2011 (or never)

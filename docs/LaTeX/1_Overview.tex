\section{Overview}

Puma uses FreeEMS vanilla firmware, PC tuning software and PUMA hardware to control fuel and ignition of large variety of engine configurations. See http://puma.freeems.org for a more detailed overview of what PUMA can do and is used for. 

We recommend you purchase the hardware such that many of the below steps aren't required. This version of the manual includes instructions for the Spin 1 board, which was generally provided as just a bare board. You will need to purchase parts based on a BOM then install those parts. You will also need to program the board via BDM programming port to get the initial bootloader installed. After the initial build, you will be able to program the board with an USB cable and a standard PC.

Note these sections are written as modules, such that sections are useful on their own, but also arranged in a sequence that is handy for a first time installer.

\section{Getting the hardware}

The design and software is OpenSource and while you can technically build it by yourself, we recommend you purchase PUMA assembled. This is how you get the hardware, blah blah blah.

Spin 1 offered just the bare board, so there are notes about how to do some low level assembly, but future spins will likely remove these assembly notes.

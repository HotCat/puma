\section{Spin1 specific notes}

1. This spin has several modifications. Start these modifications by cut the wrong traces, and adding jumpers as shown below.

2. You have the PCB + components, so get KICAD and the files, or the pdf files from puma.freeems.org. PDFs aren't search-able so you may want to choose to install KICAD until we workout that.

3. Start the assembly!

Just solder the components. If you ordered a board, you should know how to do it. An oven is a fast way to get it done.

Don't put too much paste for the small regulator, or it will get misaligned.

Components that shouldn't be populated:
F1, F3 (Fuses)
R226, R227, Q18, Q19, bridge pin 1 and 3 of Q19 (this is the shutdown circuit)
R133 (bad pullup)
R228 OR R229, using one of them defines whether the XOR negates or not its outputs.
If you use VR inputs, R212, R213, R215, and R216 should be bigger, like ¼ or ½W. 10Kohm to 20 kohm will be fine.
U18, R186, R187, C107, D74, D75, C106 (thermocouple driver)

5. Program the MCU using a BDM pod.

Install Codewarrior, open the programmer, go to File-> Load application, and select the .s12 (FreeEMS serial monitor).

It should get connected, program it, verify, and never complain.

6. Load FreeEMS firmware, using seank's loader.

7. Install  MTX and connect to the board to the PC to check that freeems is running.

22. maybe choose a better power connector for ign, 12v and injectors ?% done
23. 5.00v voltage reference for Vref ?% done
25. MAP and AAP mounting ?% done
32. more test pins to verify components are correct
33. RPM LED
34. Text searchable PDF
35. finish and check the connection .xls sheet
36. connector under s12X for expansion options on the connector card.
37. make 2 of the primary 232 via's plated such that wires can be attached. These vias already exist, change them to be plated
39. BRV from the nice 12v
44. Add a pullup on RxD0, maybe with a pnp transistor
45. pullup FT232 LEDs
46. more screws to attach the connector board
47. flip MAP
48. change thermistor circuits?
